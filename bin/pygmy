  long_desc <<-LONGDESC
    Bring up pygmy services (dnsmasq, haproxy, resolv, ssh-agent)

    When run, there will be two docker containers started:

    - dnsmasq: to resolve DNS requests for your the domain *.docker.amazee.io (unless you add --no-resolver)

    - haproxy: to forward HTTP and HTTPs requests to the docker containers running Drupal.

    - ssh-agent: to keep the ssh-agent at one single place, so that all other docker containers
      can consume the ssh key. You can bypass automatically adding keys to the agent by using --no-addkey.

    On Linux: The local resolver (/etc/resolv.conf) will be configured to use the dnsmasq
    instance as a nameserver. (unless you add --no-resolver)

    On Mac: A resolver file (/etc/resolver/docker.amazee.io) will be created to use the dnsmasq
    instance as a nameserver for all *.docker.amazee.io domains. (unless you add --no-resolver)
