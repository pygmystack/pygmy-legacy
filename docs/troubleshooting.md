# Troubleshooting local development environments


# Generic Issues

For most problems with the Docker Development environment, it's the best to restart all shared and Drupal specific Docker containers.

### Restart shared Docker containers

This is done either in `pygmy`

    pygmy restart -d

now you should also restart the Drupal specific Containers:

### Restart Drupal Containers

needs to be done separate for each Drupal container. Run this command where the `docker-compose.yml` is:

    docker-compose restart

sometimes this is not enough, we can tell docker compose to recreate the containers:

    docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

If this still is not enough, this is the ðŸ”¨  method:

    docker-compose down -v
    docker-compose up

{% hint style='danger' %}
This will remove your whole local MySQL database and maybe existing other local created volumes (like the solr search index).
{% endhint %}

### Drupal Container logs

The above commands all assume that something is wrong with the containers, sometimes though the issue lies somewhere else.
To find such issues, we need to analyze the docker logs, do that via:


    docker-compose logs

### Shared container logs

To see the logs of the shared container started via `pygmy`, first display all docker containers:

    docker ps

    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
    9e27b9eadc67        amazeeio/drupal:php70-basic   "/sbin/my_init"          5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32782->3306/tcp   amazee_io.docker.amazee.io
    5ce655cd369f        andyshinn/dnsmasq:2.75        "dnsmasq -k -A /docke"   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       0.0.0.0:53->53/tcp, 0.0.0.0:53->53/udp     amazeeio-dnsmasq
    124b3919e89a        amazeeio/ssh-agent            "/run.sh ssh-agent"      24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes                                                  amazeeio-ssh-agent
    93eb7a384640        amazeeio/haproxy              "/app/docker-entrypoi"   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp   amazeeio-haproxy

You can see three containers that have names with starting `amazeeio-` these are the shared containers.

You can view each container's logs via:

    docker logs -f [container name]

Btw, you can also see the logs of the Drupal Containers, via that command.

### I get an error like `Permission denied (publickey).` and I only see an alias for `@none` in `drush sa`

First try restarting your container, it may have lost the volume mount to the ssh-agent

```
docker-compose up --force -d
```

If that does not resolve the issue, restart pygmy

```
pygmy restart -d
```

### I get an error like `Conflict. The name "/amazee_io.docker.amazee.io" is already in use by container`

It happened to all of us, you remove a local `docker-compose.yml` file, recreate it and now during `docker-compose up -d`, docker yells at you and tells you this container exists already.

The easiest way would be to just give your new container another name, but there are better ways:

#### Remove a container

1. Find the name of the container you would like to completely remove via:

        docker ps

        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
        9e27b9eadc67        amazeeio/drupal:php70-basic   "/sbin/my_init"          10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes       80/tcp, 443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32782->3306/tcp   amazee_io.docker.amazee.io

2. Stop the container

        docker stop amazee_io.docker.amazee.io

3. Remove the container with it's volumes:

        docker rm -v amazee_io.docker.amazee.io

#### Remove all containers and all volumes

You shouldn't really need to do this, and if you think so, first try the above help. But sometimes the best way is to completely restart:

    docker rm -vf $(docker ps -q -a)

This will stop and remove **all** containers and **all** attached volumes.

{% hint style='danger' %}
This will remove your whole local MySQL database and maybe existing other local created volumes (like the solr search index).
{% endhint %}


If you get an error like `cannot create temp file for here-document: No space left on device` then you can free up space by removing old volumes and images that we don't need anymore:

    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

If you also want to get rid of all the docker images you can run:

    docker rmi $(docker images -q)


Now you have a completely empty Docker, now it's time to start again with `pygmy`.

### No space left on device

If you need to free up some disk space, you can do this:
  - start all containers that you need to preserve
  - run the following commands
    ```
    docker system prune
    docker image prune -a
    docker volume prune
    ```

### I get an error like `port is already allocated.` during start

If during the start of Docker containers you see an error like that:

    docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint
    amazeeio-haproxy (654d1f1c17b0f7304570a763e1017808b214b81648045a5c64ed6a395daeec92):
    Bind for 0.0.0.0:443 failed: port is already allocated.

This means that another service (can be another Docker container, or in case of Linux based systems another service like an installed nginx) is already using this Port.

You should stop this service or Docker container first.

### I get an error like `Service "drupal" mounts volumes from "amazeeio-ssh-agent", which is not the name of a service or container.`

This can happen when you start a Drupal Container via `docker-compose up -d` and the pygmy service has stopped

    docker-compose up -d
    ERROR: Service "drupal" mounts volumes from "amazeeio-ssh-agent", which is not the name of a service or container.

The Drupal Containers are depending on the `ssh-agent` shared Docker container (this is in order to have shared ssh-keys) and somehow this container is missing.

Try to restart `pygmy` , this will create the `ssh-agent` container with the name `amazeeio-ssh-agent` and then try again.

### Working Offline

Amazeeio uses a remote DNS server to resolve your `*.docker.amazee.io` addresses which means if you don't have an internet connection you are not going to be able to get to your site. However, you can use your `hosts` file in this scenario. This file is typically located at `/etc/hosts` on Linux and macOS and `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\host` on Windows. You will need administrative privileges to edit this file.

If you are unfamiliar with this process, follow this tutorial at [How-To Geek](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/).

### Host entry if using pygmy

```bash
127.0.0.1 awesomesauce.docker.amazee.io
```


### I can't connect to an app running in docker from another VM (commonly to test in IE)

If you are running the Windows VM in VirtualBox, you can configure it to use the host DNS resolver:

    VBoxManage modifyvm "IE11 - Win10" --natdnshostresolver1 on

Replace `"IE11 - Win10"` with the name of your VM. This will allow the VM to resolve and connect directly to your `http://*.docker.amazee.io` services running in pygmy.

#### For pygmy

An additional step is required if you use pygmy. Domains have to be added to Windows `hosts` file. They should point to the gateway IP address.

To get the gateway IP, run `ipconfig` in Windows terminal, and search for `Default Gateway` in the output.

Example `hosts` file contents:

    10.0.2.2 my-local-website.com.docker.amazee.io

### I get an error like `no such service: amazeeio-ssh-agent` when using `docker-compose up` even after pygmy started fine

Restart pygmy and make sure that pygmy could start the ssh-agent container.

    pygmy restart
    pygmy status

You could see a message like this:

    [*] ssh-agent: Running as docker container amazeeio-ssh-agent, loaded keys:
    The agent has no identities.

If you have recently updated Docker Desktop you should ensure that your turn off Docker Compose v2 support.

1. Open Docker Desktop Preferences
1. Uncheck the option labelled "Use Docker Compose v2"
1. Click Apply and Restart

Once completed, try starting pygmy and run your `docker-compose up` commands again.

    pygmy up
    docker-compose up

## pygmy

Most issues with `pygmy` can be resolved with:

![Have you tried turning it off and on again?](/assets/itsupport.gif)


    pygmy restart -d

If that does not help, try and restart other services, in this order:

1. Docker
2. Reboot your computer

### I get an error like `listen tcp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use` during `pygmy up`

If during starting of `pygmy` you see an error like that:

        Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint amazeeio-dnsmasq:
        Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:53: bind: address already in use
        Error: failed to start containers: amazeeio-dnsmasq

You are probably on Ubuntu and the by default started DNS server by Ubuntu conflicts with the one we provide with `pygmy`. The resolution depends on Ubuntu version.  

#### Ubuntu before 18.04
You should disable it, see here: http://askubuntu.com/a/233223 (no worries, the default started DNS server is actually not used, so it's safe to disable it).

#### Ubuntu 18.04 and later
You should disable it as described https://mmoapi.com/post/how-to-disable-dnsmasq-port-53-listening-on-ubuntu-18-04.  
Instead of reboot the system, remove */etc/resolv.conf*  file (still symlinking to a systemd-resolved file) and create an empty one.

    sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf  
    sudo touch /etc/resolv.conf

If you still run into the error run following command `sudo netstat -tulpn` to see the processlist look for the service running on port 53 (you should find that process in the `Local Address` column). Look for the Process ID (PID)

With the Process ID you can now run following command:

> sudo kill [Process ID]
